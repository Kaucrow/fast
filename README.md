## Development Workflow

### Branching & Collaboration

1. **Branches**: Each team must work in their dedicated branch (e.g., team-1, team-2). If necessary, each team may create additional branches using the format: `team-x-feature` where `x` is the number of the team, and `feature` is the feature that is being worked on.

2. **Commit Changes:**
Push commits only to your assigned branches, and use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/#summary) specification when adding a commit message. Write clear, descriptive commit messages that explain what changed and why.

    Good Examples:
    * fix: Prevent card text overflow in mobile view
    * feat: Add dark mode toggle button
    * docs: Update button component usage examples

    Bad Examples:
    * fix: it works now (Too vague)
    * feat: changes (No context)
    * update code (Missing type prefix)

3. **Really now, commit changes:**
Please push commits to the remote repository as often as possible, in order to properly track the development of each component.

4. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**:
Once your feature is complete, open a PR from team-[X] → dev for review.

⚠️ Do not push directly to main or dev. All merges require approval

### Progress Reports

To maintain code quality and alignment, each team must weekly designate one member to present a quick progress report via Discord during their assigned Tuesday time slot:

* **Team 2**: 2:00pm
* **Team 3**: 2:30pm
* **Team 4**: 3:00pm

If you cannot attend, please notify me in advance so we can arrange an alternative meeting at URU.
